We continue our tutorial on Concuerror, explaining the errors it can detect and
the options that you can use to filter out those that are not important for your
application.

Symbolic names
--------------

Concuerror makes an effort to replace every Erlang PID that appears in its
report with a symbolic name. The first process spawned is labelled *P* and
every other process is named after the process that spawned it, with an integer
denoting the order in which it was spawned i.e. *P*'s first "child" is named
*P.1*, *P.1*'s third child is named *P.1.3* and so on.

If you prefer to see the raw PIDs you can use
`--symbolic_names false`. Concuerror is reusing the same processes, so the
results should be consistent across different interleavings.

Abnormal exits
--------------

Every time a process exits abnormally, Concuerror will mark the interleaving as
erroneous. This means that any exception that escapes to the top-level will
trigger a warning. [In our example]({% post_url 2014-06-02-poolboy-example%}/#using--pa-to-add-directories-in-erlangs-code-path),
processes *P*, *P.1.1* and *P.1.1.1* exited abnormally.

{% highlight text %}
{% raw %}
Erroneous interleaving 1:
* At step 52 process P exited abnormally
    Reason:
      {timeout,{gen_server,call,[P.1,stop]}}
    Stacktrace:
      [{gen_server,call,2,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,182}]},
       {poolboy_tests_1,pool_startup,0,
                        [{file,"poolboy_tests_1.erl"},{line,8}]}]
* At step 76 process P.1.1.1 exited abnormally
    Reason:
      shutdown
    Stacktrace:
      []
* At step 85 process P.1.1 exited abnormally
    Reason:
      shutdown
    Stacktrace:
      [{proc_lib,exit_p,2,[{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,260}]}]
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Ignoring "after" timeouts

If we take a look at the trace we can see that *P* triggered the standard
timeout clause of a `gen` call:

{% highlight text %}
  50: P: receive timeout expired after 5000 ms
    in gen.erl line 213
  [...]
  52: P: exits abnormally ({timeout,{gen_server,call,[P.1,stop]}})
{% endhighlight %}

As explained
[here](/faq/#how-does-concuerror-handle-timeouts-and-other-time-related-functions),
Concuerror by default assumes that any *receive* statement may trigger the
*after* clause, unless it is impossible for a matching message not to have
already arrived.

However, let's assume that we don't care about such timeouts. We can use the
`--after_timeout 1000` to treat any timeout *higher than 1000ms* as
*infinity*. Notice that the one of the tips we got earlier suggests the same
course of action:

{% highlight text %}
Tip: A process crashed with reason '{timeout, ...}'. This may happen when a call
  to a gen_server (or similar) does not receive a reply within some standard
  timeout. Use the '--after_timeout' option to treat after clauses that exceed some
  threshold as 'impossible'.  
{% endhighlight %}

### Treating abnormal exit reasons as normal

The other two processes exited abnormally because they were terminated by events
generated by the delivery of a `stop` message to a supervisor. The supervisor
then sent `shutdown` exit signals to the relevant processes. Again, let's assume
that this is acceptable behaviour in our context, using `--treat_as_normal
shutdown` (also suggested by a tip).

{% highlight text %}
Tip: A process crashed with reason 'shutdown'. This may happen when a supervisor
  is terminating its children. You can use '--treat_as_normal shutdown' if this is
  expected behavior.
{% endhighlight %}

A report without problems
-------------------------

We now run Concuerror again, using the new options:

{% highlight bash %}
poolboy $ concuerror -f poolboy_tests_1.erl -m poolboy_tests_1 -t pool_startup \
  --pa .eunit --after_timeout 1000 --treat_as_normal shutdown
{% endhighlight %}

This time the output finishes in:

{% highlight text %}
[...]
Warning: Some abnormal exit reasons were treated as normal ('--treat_as_normal').
Done! (Exit status: completed)
  Summary: 0 errors, ... interleavings explored
{% endhighlight %}

Concuerror finished the exploration, finding all the different states that the
program can reach. None of these interleavings had any processes terminating
abnormally with a reason different from `shutdown`, nor any other errors.

### Interleavings as a graph

Concuerror can also produce a
[DOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) file,
including all the interleavings. This feature can be enabled with `--graph <filename>`.
You can then use [`dot`](http://linux.die.net/man/1/dot) to convert
the DOT file to an image.

### Racing events

 The report includes a section where each pair of events that are racing is
reported, to justify each additional interleaving. Let's take a look at the
output:

{% highlight text %}
[...]
################################################################################
Race Pairs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can disable race pair messages with '--show_races false'
* Exit signal (normal) from P.1 reaches P.1.1
   is in race with
  Message ({'DOWN',#Ref<0.0.0.508>,process,P.1.1.1,shutdown}) from P.1.1.1 reaches P.1.1
* Message ({'DOWN',#Ref<0.0.0.508>,process,P.1.1.1,shutdown}) from P.1.1.1 reaches P.1.1
   is in race with
  Timer #Ref<0.0.0.522>: expires, delivering {timeout,#Ref<0.0.0.522>,kill} to P.1.1
* P.1: exits normally
   is in race with
  P: true = erlang:demonitor(#Ref<0.0.0.407>, [flush])
    in gen.erl line 215
{% endhighlight %}

We can see e.g. that the delivery of an exit signal from a linked process races
with the delivery of an arbitrary message, (since `P.1.1` is trapping exits), a
similar race appears between a message from a timer and finally a process
exiting races with the cancellation of a monitor, as the monitor message will be
sent in one case but not in the other.

The same pair of events may be reported multiple times, but this should happen
only if we are exploring the reverse interleaving of a different race.

**If you see a pair of events that you believe should not be racing, feel free
  to [report the
  discrepancy!](https://github.com/parapluu/Concuerror/issues/new) Concuerror's
  race detection accuracy is the most sensitive component regarding the total
  number of interleavings explored!**

"Deadlocked" processes
---------------------

Since we called `poolboy:stop/1`, all processes were properly stopped. What
would happen if we had let a process lingering? We already have such a test,
`pool_startup_no_stop/0` (we need to use `poolboy:start/1` instead of
`start_link`, as the normal exit signal from the initial process also causes a
shutdown).

{% gist aronisstav/b67df16361cd9a2fa87e %}

Running this test, yields:

{% highlight bash %}
poolboy $ concuerror -f poolboy_tests_1.erl -m poolboy_tests_1 --pa .eunit \
 -t pool_startup_no_stop
Concuerror started at 03 Jun 2014 12:00:00
Writing results in concuerror_report.txt
[...]
Done! (Exit status: warning)
  Summary: 1 errors, 1/1 interleavings explored
{% endhighlight %}

The output file now contains the following description:

{% highlight text %}
Erroneous interleaving 1:
* Blocked at a 'receive' ("deadlocked"; other processes have exited):
    P.1 in gen_server.erl line 360
    P.1.1 in gen_server.erl line 360
    P.1.1.1 in gen_server.erl line 360
{% endhighlight %}

Concuerror reports any processes that have not exited, when no other processes
are available to run. Such processes are blocked at a *receive* statement and
are considered "deadlocked". These warnings can be turned off by `--ignore_error
deadlock`.

Concuerror will always reset the test to the initial state, so leaving some
processes running may be a better alternative to suffering from all the races
between exit signals that appear at termination.
